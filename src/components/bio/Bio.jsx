                    <p>
                        Hi there! I'm Isidro Brylle Mutia, and I work as a fullstack web developer. I spent 5 years completing my Computer Engineering
                        degree where I was exposed to both the hardware and software fields of technology, with a bit of math (like 60% of it). Then
                        as I immerse myself to different technologies, I realized that the software field is where I want to be, where I can help
                        those people in need and give as much impact to the world as a whole.
                    </p>

                        <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've dabbled with multiple programming languages throughout those 5 years, such as C++, C#, Python and JavaScript. I also
                            tried different fields of programming such as game development, machine learning, embedded systems, programmable logic
                            controllers, and eventually settled with web development.
                        </p>
